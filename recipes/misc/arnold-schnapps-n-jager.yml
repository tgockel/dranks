    Listen up everybody, we're going to play a game called "The Arnold Schnapps 'n Jäger."
    After drinking the shot, each member drinking the shot must say an Arnold Schwarzenegger one-liner that is unique to the group to the night.
    If someone says "I'll be back," that quote is terminated for the evening.
    Repeating a quote or being unable to totally recall a quote means you are sent to the chopper (which, in this case, means you take another shot).
